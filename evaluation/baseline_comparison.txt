Analysis: Baseline vs LLM-RAG
======================================================================

📋 Baseline (Template-only):
   Pros:
   + Fast and deterministic
   + No API costs
   + Predictable output format

   Cons:
   - Generic, repetitive responses
   - Cannot understand context or nuance
   - Limited to recipe titles only
   - No reasoning or explanation

🤖 LLM-RAG:
   Pros:
   + Natural, conversational answers
   + Understands query intent
   + Provides relevant details (calories, health, etc.)
   + Can explain reasoning

   Cons:
   - Requires API calls (cost ~$0.02 for 20 queries)
   - Slight latency (1-2 seconds per query)
   - Non-deterministic output

======================================================================
Conclusion:
======================================================================
LLM-RAG provides significantly better answer quality by:

• Explaining why recipes are recommended

The small API cost (~$0.001 per query) is worthwhile for the
dramatically improved user experience.
